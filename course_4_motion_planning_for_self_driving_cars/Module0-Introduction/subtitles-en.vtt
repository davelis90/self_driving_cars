00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.700
Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.135
the fourth course of our
self-driving car specialization.

3
00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.280
In this course,
we're going to focus

4
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.350
on motion planning problems,

5
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.970
as well as some of the techniques

6
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.030
we can use to solve them.

7
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.770
At a very high level,

8
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.280
the motion planning problem is

9
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.380
the task of generating
the path and

10
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.940
velocities required to get

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.170
the autonomous car from
point A to point B.

12
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.940
To do this, we will
require the perception and

13
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.000
sensing information we
described in previous courses.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.830
As motion planning requires

15
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.125
having knowledge of
the surrounding cars,

16
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.050
pedestrians, and other obstacles
in the environment.

17
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.450
Because of the complexity
of the problem,

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.160
it is common to decompose

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.330
the planning problem into
smaller sub-problems.

20
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.980
In this course, we will focus on

21
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.100
three-stage hierarchy
of mission planning,

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.040
which involves map level
navigation which you are likely

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.690
familiar with from planning trips

24
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.475
with online mapping tools,

25
00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.010
behavior planning which ensures

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.040
our driving behavior follows
the rules of the road,

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.020
and local planning which ensures

28
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.945
our paths are smooth
and collision-free.

29
00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:38.825
Once we've introduced the
motion planning problem

30
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.765
as well as our planning
hierarchy in module one,

31
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.540
we will focus on methods
to solve each of

32
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.460
the planning
sub-problems throughout

33
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.160
the rest of the course.

34
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.810
In module two, we will discuss

35
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.480
mapping in the context
of autonomous driving,

36
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.659
as well as how we
represent static obstacles

37
00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.005
that our planner must avoid
during the planning process.

38
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.900
Both of these maps are
necessary components for

39
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.650
generating a safe trajectory
for our autonomous vehicle.

40
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.880
Next, we will focus on mission
planning in module three,

41
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.760
which is the highest level part
of our planning problem.

42
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.970
We will use the maps
generated in module two,

43
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.530
to navigate as efficiently

44
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.780
as possible to our destination.

45
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.535
Moving to module four,

46
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.400
we will focus on how the
autonomous vehicle interacts

47
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.170
with other moving agents
in the driving scene,

48
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.040
which is a complex task
that is essential to

49
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.340
ensuring safety during
the planning process.

50
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.010
In module five, we will focus

51
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.380
on the sub-problem of
behavioral planning,

52
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.090
which is the task of determining

53
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.360
which behaviors the autonomous
vehicle should exhibit,

54
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.955
depending on the vehicles
surrounding environment.

55
00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.915
From here, we will move to
local planning in module six.

56
00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:53.315
Where we introduce
a reactive planner

57
00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:55.880
to generate trajectories
for a bicycle model,

58
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.150
which we introduced
in course one.

59
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.580
Finally, in module seven,

60
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.010
we conclude by creating
a decoupled path planner and

61
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.590
velocity profile generator that

62
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.630
builds upon our reactive planner.

63
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.540
It can generate paths
and velocity profiles,

64
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.590
that can be used by

65
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.260
an autonomous vehicle
for on-road driving.

66
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.690
Throughout this course,
we will be giving

67
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.460
you assignments that will test

68
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.200
your ability to implement

69
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.260
the sub-components of
our hierarchical motion planner.

70
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.360
This will give you
the hands-on experience

71
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.755
required to develop

72
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.245
a fully integrated
motion planning system

73
00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:31.850
in the final course project.

74
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.215
Where you will develop

75
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:36.230
a full motion planning system
in the Carlos simulator.

76
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.180
I hope you're as excited as I am

77
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.100
to dive into the
motion planning problem.

78
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.330
So let's get started.
